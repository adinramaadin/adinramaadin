# üí´ About Me:
<br>Hi, I‚Äôm Farhan Aditya Ramadhan, a fourth-year Economics student at Universitas Indonesia. My days are a mix of spreadsheets, Python scripts, and big questions aabout how economics shapes the world. Right now, I‚Äôm interning at the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM), where I dive into oil, gas, and mining production forecasts, crunch numbers, and research sustainable energy policies‚Äîall with the goal of making sense of complex problems.<br><br>Outside the office, I‚Äôve been knee-deep in projects that turn raw data into stories worth telling. From creating salary dashboards and analyzing job market trends to building economics models that explore the ripple effects of policy changes, I‚Äôve learned how to extract meaning from data. Along the way, I‚Äôve gotten pretty comfortable with tools like Python, SQL, and Excel.<br><br>Lately, I‚Äôve been exploring how land reform and manufacturing policies shape industries. It‚Äôs fascinating to see how economic strategies play out in the real world. I‚Äôm also digging deeper into data science and economic modeling, sharpening skills that help me connect the dots in new and unexpected ways.<br><br>But it‚Äôs not all about numbers for me‚ÄîI‚Äôm fascinated by people. I love learning about different cultures, languages, and perspectives. It‚Äôs thrilling to connect with others and understand the world through their eyes, discovering the stories that make us unique yet interconnected.<br><br>I also have a passion for tech‚Äîespecially how tech companies are working to democratize advanced technologies and make them accessible to all demographics. It‚Äôs incredible to see how innovations, particularly in the smartphone industry, can change the way we live and interact with the world.<br><br>At the heart of it all, I‚Äôm just someone who loves to learn, explore, and connect. Whether it‚Äôs through data, economics, or understanding what makes people tick, I‚Äôm always up for the next adventure.
